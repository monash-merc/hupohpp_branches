                &lt;p&gt;The goal of the Seattle Proteome Center (SPC) is to evolve as a local, highly interactive,
                multi-disciplinary group, bringing together scientific expertise from diverse areas such as biology,
                chemistry, proteomics, physics, bioinformatics, and statistics, to enhance and develop innovative
                proteomic technologies and apply them to biological questions relevant to systems biology and,
                ultimately, human health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The focus of the Center is the development of an array of new, systematic tools and techniques
                for the analysis of proteins and to create assays to comprehensively study the dynamics of cells in
                health and disease. Validated technologies with generic applicability are broadly disseminated here from
                both tools, techniques and comprehensive data sets in an open source manner.&lt;/p&gt;
