                The Proteome Browser is an analysis tool which integrates protein data from a number of proteomics
                and genomic data sources. It displays a &amp;quot;Traffic Light&amp;quot; report , where the X axis will
                relate to each gene (i.e. protein) ordered by default in the order found on the Chromosome, and the Y
                axis relates to the various protein data sources/sets.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                The &amp;quot;traffic light&amp;quot; system is used to indicate cases where different types of data
                exists and does not exist for a particular protein. Various aspects of the underlying contributing
                information is envisaged to be available for further analyses using clustering and drill down/through
                capabilities. The screen is dynamic showing relevant information according to the type of information
                selected on the Traffic Light Report and will provide links to external systems where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                Example analytical functions that are envisaged include: Hierarchical clustering of protein data on the
                X axis based on the information of the other axis (similar in function to clustering tools that are
                currently used to classify gene expression data across 10&amp;rsquo;s of 1000&amp;rsquo;s of data
                points). Similar, yet directed analysis of specific proteins based on functional classification (e.g.
                only enzymes or structural proteins (and many subsets thereof)), disease involvement (e.g. only those
                associated with diabetes, heart disease) is also envisaged. These analysis functions will assist in
                producing a resource that will help elucidate biological and molecular function and advance diagnosis
                and treatment of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
